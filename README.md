# To view on mobile device

The easiest way to view on a mobile device is via ngrok.
Which means [signing up for, and installing, ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

Once installed, you can run
> ./ngrok http localhost:3000

This will give you a URL that you can then browse to from any device, that will point to your local running instance.
